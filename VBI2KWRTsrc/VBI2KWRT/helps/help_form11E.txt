空気       |くーき               (when required to replace "う" by ("ー")
本町       |ほんまち 
町         |ちょう
環境汚染   |かんきょう　おせん   (required space to split word)
飛び地     |　とびち             (Space is prefixed)

The rows with "Del" is checked on is deleted at "OK" is clicked.

Column header "String" sorts by sequense of values of "String" column.
